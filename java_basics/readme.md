What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and general-purpose programming language. It is widely used for building desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise applications.
lay man words — like a language we use to talk to people, Java is a language to talk to computers and tell them what to do.
### 🧠 Imagine this:
You want your computer to:
* Show a message on the screen,
* Calculate your marks,
* Create a mobile app,
* Run a game...
**Java is the tool that helps you make all this happen.**
### 🛠️ Simple facts about Java:
1. ✅ **Easy to use** – Even beginners can learn it.
2. 📱 **Used everywhere** – Websites, apps, games, and even ATMs!
3. 💻 **Runs on any computer** – One code works on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
4. 🧩 **Works like LEGO** – You build small pieces (called classes) and join them to make big software.

### 🧾 A simple Java example:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
This small program simply tells the computer to print **"Hello, world!"**
### 🚀 In short:
**Java is like a magic pen** 🖊️ that lets you write instructions for a computer to follow — whether you're making an app, solving maths problems, or building the next Futuristic app

Java Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
