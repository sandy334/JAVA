What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and general-purpose programming language. It is widely used for building desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise applications.
lay man words — like a language we use to talk to people, Java is a language to talk to computers and tell them what to do.
### 🧠 Imagine this:
You want your computer to:
* Show a message on the screen,
* Calculate your marks,
* Create a mobile app,
* Run a game...
**Java is the tool that helps you make all this happen.**
### 🛠️ Simple facts about Java:
1. ✅ **Easy to use** – Even beginners can learn it.
2. 📱 **Used everywhere** – Websites, apps, games, and even ATMs!
3. 💻 **Runs on any computer** – One code works on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
4. 🧩 **Works like LEGO** – You build small pieces (called classes) and join them to make big software.

### 🧾 A simple Java example:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
This small program simply tells the computer to print **"Hello, world!"**
### 🚀 In short:
**Java is like a magic pen** 🖊️ that lets you write instructions for a computer to follow — whether you're making an app, solving maths problems, or building the next Futuristic app
