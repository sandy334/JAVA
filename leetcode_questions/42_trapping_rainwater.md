# ðŸ’§ LeetCode 42: Trapping Rain Water - Solution Explained

This document provides a detailed explanation of the two-pointer approach to solve the "Trapping Rain Water" problem.

---

## Problem Description

Given an array of non-negative integers `height` representing an elevation map, the goal is to compute how much water can be trapped between the bars after raining.

The amount of water trapped above any single bar is determined by the height of the water level minus the bar's own height. The water level is constrained by the shorter of two walls: the tallest bar to its left and the tallest bar to its right.

Water at index `i` = `min(max_left_wall, max_right_wall) - height[i]`

## The Two-Pointer Algorithm

The provided code uses an efficient **two-pointer approach** to solve this problem in a single pass, which is much more optimal than calculating left and right maxes for each bar individually.

The core idea is to maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the ends of the array, and two variables, `leftMax` and `rightMax`, to track the maximum height encountered so far from each side.

1.  **Initialization**:
    * `left` pointer starts at index `0`.
    * `right` pointer starts at the last index, `height.length - 1`.
    * `leftMax` is initialized to the height of the `left` bar.
    * `rightMax` is initialized to the height of the `right` bar.
    * `water` is initialized to `0`.

2.  **Iteration Logic**:
    The pointers move inward as long as `left < right`. In each step, we compare `leftMax` and `rightMax`.

    * **If `leftMax < rightMax`**: This comparison is key. It tells us that the water level on the left side is **guaranteed to be limited by `leftMax`**. The taller `rightMax` ensures that water won't spill over from the right side. Therefore, we can safely calculate the trapped water for the current `left` position.
        * We move the `left` pointer inward.
        * We update `leftMax`.
        * We add `leftMax - height[left]` to our total `water`.

    * **If `rightMax <= leftMax`**: Symmetrically, the water level on the right side is limited by `rightMax`. We can safely calculate the trapped water for the current `right` position.
        * We move the `right` pointer inward.
        * We update `rightMax`.
        * We add `rightMax - height[right]` to our total `water`.

The loop terminates when the pointers meet, and `water` holds the total volume.

## Code and Walkthrough

Here is the Java code implementing the algorithm.

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        // Return 0 if the array is too small to trap water
        if (height == null || height.length < 3) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;

        int leftMax = height[left];
        int rightMax = height[right];

        int water = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            // The water level is limited by the smaller of the two maxes.
            if (leftMax < rightMax) {
                // Move the left pointer
                left++;
                // Update the left max height
                leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, height[left]);
                // Calculate trapped water at this position
                water += leftMax - height[left];
            } else {
                // Move the right pointer
                right--;
                // Update the right max height
                rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, height[right]);
                // Calculate trapped water at this position
                water += rightMax - height[right];
            }
        }
        return water;
    }
}
